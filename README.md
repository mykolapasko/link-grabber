Test task for Node JS developer position 
Story
As a user, I want a tool for evaluating website performance.  

Acceptance criteria     

It should be a web site, ExpressJS or another framework (suggestion: you can use bootstrap for UI)  
It should be a page with a text box where a user can enter the URL.  
Application has built a sitemap based on the URL using links in the HTML document.
Measure response time for each page.  
The test result should display pages speed graphically (top of the page).  
The test result should display page speed as a table (bottom of the page). 
The table should contain min and max values for each page. 
Slowest requests should be on top.  
Source code for the task should be uploaded to GitHub or Bitbucket Notes Approach, tools, the database engine can be selected by the candidate (suggestion: use mongolab as database hosting). 
It would be super cool in case response time is showed in real time. However, it is not required.
